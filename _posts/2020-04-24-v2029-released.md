InspIRCd v2.0.29 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v2.0.29).

This release fixes a crash bug in the pgsql module.

As mentioned previously InspIRCd v2 is now deprecated and will no longer receive security updates after ~~2020-05-31~~ **2020-12-31**. You should strongly consider updating to the v3 branch as soon as possible. Documentation on how to do so is available on [the docs site](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes).
