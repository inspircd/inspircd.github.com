InspIRCd v3.1.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v3.1.0).

This release fixes a crash bug in the silence module as well as adding several minor features. Most notably:

- Fixed a **crash** in the silence module when built with older GCCs.
- Fixed an inverted condition in the commonchans module which made the module not work.
- Fixed pending X-lines only being applied to a single user.
- Added support for disabling a STS policy for users in specific connect classes.
- Added support for the IRCv3 Message IDs specification.

No breaking configuration changes have been made since the v3.0.0 release but if you are upgrading from v2 please consult our [list of config changes in v3](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes).
