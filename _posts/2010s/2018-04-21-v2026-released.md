InspIRCd v2.0.26 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v2.0.26).

This release contains bug fixes and documentation corrections. Most notably:

 - m\_banredirect no longer creates phantom redirects in some rare cases.
 - m\_cgiirc clients connecting from [GZK]Lined hosts through an ELined gateway are now banned correctly.
 - m\_swhois messages set via an oper block are now correctly removed on deoper.
 - m\_xline_db and m\_spanningtree now store the correct user as the XLine setter.

All users are recommended to upgrade.
