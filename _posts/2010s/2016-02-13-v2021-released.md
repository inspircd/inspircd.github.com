InspIRCd v2.0.21 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v2.0.21).


This is a bugfix only release, fixing issues discovered since 2.0.20. An issue has been fixed in m_namedmodes which allowed non-opers to obtain the key (`+k`) of a channel. This release also features build system fixes, more aggressive DNS cache pruning, increased default DH bit size to 2048 when generating DH params via `configure`, increased compatibility during `CAP` negotiation with some clients and various documentation enhancements.

Note for Windows users: the GnuTLS library which ships as part of the InspIRCd Windows installer has been upgraded to the 3.4 branch because the 3.2 branch of GnuTLS which we used previously is no longer maintained. GnuTLS 3.4.x is not compatible with Windows XP.
