As InspIRCd v3 was recently released v2 is approaching the end of its life.

Non-security bug fixes will no longer be provided as of 2019-06-01.

Fixes for security vulnerabilities will be provided until ~~2020-06-01~~ **2021-01-01**.

After this date the v2 branch will be considered dead and will not receive any more fixes.

If you are using v2 please consult our [list of config changes in v3](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes) on the docs site for information on how to upgrade to v3.
