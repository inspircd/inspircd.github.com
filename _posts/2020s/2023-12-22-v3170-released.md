InspIRCd v3.17.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v3.17.0).

The most notable changes in this release are:

- Added an example post-deploy hook script for use with CertBot, Dehydrated, or other ACME SSL (TLS) renewal tools.

- Changed SVSHOLDs to also force existing users to change their nick on add.

- Fixed a crash on shutdown on some systems when using `--nofork` and the ssl_gnutls module.

- Fixed sending nick/user/host changes from the wrong mask when using the ircv3_labeledresponse module.
