In a few days InspIRCd v2 was planned to reach the end of its life. However, as many things have been suspended for a few months due to COVID-19 and will likely remain suspended for a few more we are extending security fixes and support for v2 to the end of 2020.

Please do not consider this an excuse to push off upgrading unless you really have to though. We will not be extending this date again.

If you are an upgrading v2 user please consult our [list of config changes in v3](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes) on the docs site for information on how to upgrade to v3.
