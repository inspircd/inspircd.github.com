InspIRCd v3.9.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v3.9.0).

The most notable changes in this release are:

- Added `<chanhistory:enableumode>` to allow enabling user mode `N` (nohistory) which allows users to opt-out of receiving channel history on join.

- Added extbans to the S2S protocol to allow services to validate bans easier.

- Added the `<shun:allowconnect>` option to allow configuring whether shuns should only be applied to users who are fully connected to the server.

- Fixed `<class:snomask>` not being parsed correctly when a type has multiple oper classes.

No breaking configuration changes have been made since the v3.0.0 release but if you are upgrading from v2 please consult our [list of config changes in v3](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes).
