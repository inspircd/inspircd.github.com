InspIRCd v2.0.28 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v2.0.28).

This release fixes a crash bug in the mysql module as well as fixing several minor issues:

- Fixed BanCache entries existing after X-line expiry.
- Replaced all references to the dead InspIRCd wiki with the new InspIRCd docs site.
- Updated all documentation links to use https.
- Updated the Module Manager source list for the new inspircd-contrib repository.

As mentioned previously InspIRCd v2 is now deprecated and will no longer receive security updates after ~~2020-05-31~~ 2020-12-31. You should strongly consider updating to the v3 branch as soon as possible. Documentation on how to do so is available on [the docs site](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes).
