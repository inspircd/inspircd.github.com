InspIRCd v3.7.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).


This release contains a few new features but is mostly bug fixes. Most notably:
- Added `<botmode:forcenotice>` to allow forcing bots to use NOTICEs instead of PRIVMSGs.
- Added support for disabling the creation/expiry notices sent to channel operators by the timedbans module.
- Fixed /SVSHOLD sending a global snotice instead of a local one.
- Fixed shuns not being applied correctly.
- Fixed the `<class:dnsbl>` option not matching marked DNSBL users.
- Fixed the `<hostchange:ports>` option never matching users.
- Fixed WebSocket users not being detected as using a secure connection when they are.
