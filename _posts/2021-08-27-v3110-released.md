InspIRCd v3.11.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

The most notable changes in this release are:

- Added `<connectban:bootwait>` to allow delaying connectban until the specified time period has passed after boot.

- Added `<connectban:splitwait>` to allow delaying connectban until the specified time period has passed after a network partition.

- Added `<gnutls:onrehash>`, `<mbedtls:onrehash>`, and `<openssl:onrehash>` to allow reloading TLS (SSL) profiles on rehash.

- Added support for setting TLS 1.3+ ciphersuites in ssl_openssl.

- Changed `<oper:autologin>` to accept a value of `if-host-match` to allow autologin to only proceed if the user's hostname matches the value in `<oper:host>`.
