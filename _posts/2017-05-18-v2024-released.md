InspIRCd v2.0.24 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v2.0.24).


This release contains minor bug fixes, including fixes to the build system and module manager to work on newer perl versions (>5.24.1) which are common on newer systems. All users are recommended to upgrade.

<!--more-->

For Windows, this is the first release built on Visual Studio 2012 instead of 2010, using platform toolset v110 - so XP support has been officially dropped (previous InspIRCd versions would run on XP - but some of the shipped 3rd party libraries like GnuTLS would not). As such, the VS 2010 runtimes are no longer required. The 2012 runtimes are now included in the installer and do not need to be installed separately.

We now have an official InspIRCd docker image available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inspircd/inspircd-docker/). Thanks to Sheogorath for his work on this. You can run it with a simple command:

```
$ docker run --name ircd -p 6667:6667 inspircd/inspircd-docker:2.0.24
```
